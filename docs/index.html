            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the world of Dew Drops, a simple and concise tabletop RPG based in the microverse, a realm populated by anthropomorphic critters standing at roughly a 10th of normal human size. Your world is perilous and the backyard vast! Let’s dig into some of the basics.</p>
            <h3>The Ascension</h3>
            <p>Though the world has become populated with the humanoid descendants of various fauna, there are still varieties of smaller animals in the world. Through a mysterious process is known as “The Ascension”, the species of this world gained sentience.</p>

        <section id="gameplay">
            <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The gameplay is based on your standard D20 with a slight twist: in Dew Drops your success is based on the proximity to the number 10. When an action is proclaimed, rolling a number 10 would be classed as a perfect action or critical success. Modifiers based on the relevant character attributes, traits and flaws determine how far off ten you can be before failing. For example, to dodge, an AGI of 1 and Athletics of 3 would mean rolling 4 below or above 10 (a roll of 6 to 14) would count as a success. This would be contested by the roll of the attacker, with the difference resulting in the damage from the attack.</p>
            <p>Conversely, the traditional “failure” scenario is applied to under/over actions at 1/20 respectively. A 1 is a drastic under-action (e.g., standing still when trying to dodge) and a 20 is an over-action, resulting in dodging but going beyond the mark, possibly tripping or crashing into something.</p>

            <h2>Character’s Creation Process</h2>
            <p>Stats and attributes are the backbone of your character, defining their raw capabilities. There are 5 main attributes: FORT, AGI, INT, WITS, and MAGIC. You start with 10 points to distribute among these attributes, with each stat starting at a base of 1.</p>
             </section>

        <section id="magic">
            <h2>Magic & Spells</h2>
            <p>Magic in Dew Drops is a rare and mysterious force, often tied to ancient Faye realms or the enigmatic shadows of the Twilight. Spells are defined and refined by the user as they develop their magical abilities. While a spell or technique can be taught to another, it is entirely up to the user to name and exert their influence on their mastered element.</p>
            <p>A spell's power is defined by the user's magic level and whether or not the spell is practiced. For each level in Magic, the player may write down a spell. For example, if they choose to write "Firewall", this becomes a learnt spell that can be called upon and gets +1 on a die roll when used. The fifth slot is regarded as an ultimate, giving +1 to critical hits when cast (meaning a result of 11-12 is regarded as a critical success). A spell that isn’t defined on the character sheet but still falls under the user's mastery is rolled like any other attribute.</p>
